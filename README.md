- Supabase as a third-party service that helps managing the authentication and authorization part of the system.
- Nginx wraps the API services to make them easier to access
- PostgreSQL is utilized to retain data (that are not handled by Supabase; e.g. transactions, payment accounts, etc.)
- Both services do not communicate directly, instead the payment manager accesses the token that is provided by Supabase, generated by authenticating through the account manager.
